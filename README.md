## How To
This design is protable lightbox and pulse sensor. To turn the device on, toggle the switch ON. An initiation screen will appear and in a few seconds, the red LED will turn on. To cycle through various modes, simply push down on the pushbutton. On every fourth push of the cycle, the LCD will display the pulse readings. You can attach or detach the pulse sensor at any moment by attaching or removing the earclip to your earlobes.<br/>
To replace the battery, simply open the box and unscrew the 1/8" bolts and expose the battery underneath. The battery cap is easily removable, and the battery replaceable.
