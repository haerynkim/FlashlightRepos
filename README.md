# FlashlightRepos
#This repository will contain the necessary components to make the flashlight project viable. The repository also includes a #project board that visualizes the tasks to be completed from time to time.
#
#About the flashlight project:
#The flashlight will contain certain features such as: variable light intensity, hard case, etc.
#
#Functional Specifications
#LED light that is button-activated to switch between the following operating modes:
#Off
#Brightest
#Intermediate Brightness
#Least Bright
#Flashing @ 2 Hz
#Self-contained device with LED and button exposed.
#Extra credit possibilities:
#Battery life indicator
#Waterproof enclosure

#Constraints
#Run on single battery up to 9 V
#Electronics connected to a single PCB (can be single- or double-sided)
#Cannot weight more than 1 lb
#Cannot have a single dimension > 6 in
#Cannot cost more than $50 to duplicate unit
#Battery must be easily replaceable
#Evaluation
#Minimize weight
#Minimize size
#Maximize Brightest mode
